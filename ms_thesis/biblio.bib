	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Structural properties of proteins such as secondary structure and solvent accessibility contribute to three-dimensional structure prediction, not only in the ab initio case but also when homology information to known structures is available. Structural properties are also routinely used in protein analysis even when homology is available, largely because homology modelling is lower throughput than, say, secondary structure prediction. Nonetheless, predictors of secondary structure and solvent accessibility are virtually always ab initio. RESULTS: Here we develop high-throughput machine learning systems for the prediction of protein secondary structure and solvent accessibility that exploit homology to proteins of known structure, where available, in the form of simple structural frequency profiles extracted from sets of PDB templates. We compare these systems to their state-of-the-art ab initio counterparts, and with a number of baselines in which secondary structures and solvent accessibilities are extracted directly from the templates. We show that structural information from templates greatly improves secondary structure and solvent accessibility prediction quality, and that, on average, the systems significantly enrich the information contained in the templates. For sequence similarity exceeding 30%, secondary structure prediction quality is approximately 90%, close to its theoretical maximum, and 2-class solvent accessibility roughly 85%. Gains are robust with respect to template selection noise, and significant for marginal sequence similarity and for short alignments, supporting the claim that these improved predictions may prove beneficial beyond the case in which clear homology is available. CONCLUSION: The predictive system are publicly available at the address http://distill.ucd.ie.},

	Abstract = {Knowing the number of residue contacts in a protein is crucial for deriving constraints useful in modeling protein folding, protein structure, and/or scoring remote homology searches. Here we use an ensemble of bi-directional recurrent neural network architectures and evolutionary information to improve the state-of-the-art in contact prediction using a large corpus of curated data. The ensemble is used to discriminate between two different states of residue contacts, characterized by a contact number higher or lower than the average value of the residue distribution. The ensemble achieves performances ranging from 70.1% to 73.1% depending on the radius adopted to discriminate contacts (6Ato 12A). These performances represent gains of 15% to 20% over the base line statistical predictors always assigning an aminoacid to the most numerous state, 3% to 7% better than any previous method. Combination of different radius predictors further improves the performance. SERVER: http://promoter.ics.uci.edu/BRNN-PRED/.},

@article{Lindorff-Larsen2005aa,
	Abstract = {The mechanism by which proteins fold to their native states has been the focus of intense research in recent years. The rate-limiting event in the folding reaction is the formation of a conformation in a set known as the transition-state ensemble. The structural features present within such ensembles have now been analysed for a series of proteins using data from a combination of biochemical and biophysical experiments together with computer-simulation methods. These studies show that the topology of the transition state is determined by a set of interactions involving a small number of key residues and, in addition, that the topology of the transition state is closer to that of the native state than to that of any other fold in the protein universe. Here, we review the evidence for these conclusions and suggest a molecular mechanism that rationalizes these findings by presenting a view of protein folds that is based on the topological features of the polypeptide backbone, rather than the conventional view that depends on the arrangement of different types of secondary-structure elements. By linking the folding process to the organization of the protein structure universe, we propose an explanation for the overwhelming importance of topology in the transition states for protein folding.},

	Abstract = {In this study, we address the problem of local quality assessment in homology models. As a prerequisite for the evaluation of methods for predicting local model quality, we first examine the problem of measuring local structural similarities between a model and the corresponding native structure. Several local geometric similarity measures are evaluated. Two methods based on structural superposition are found to best reproduce local model quality assessments by human experts. We then examine the performance of state-of-the-art statistical potentials in predicting local model quality on three qualitatively distinct data sets. The best statistical potential, DFIRE, is shown to perform on par with the best current structure-based method in the literature, ProQres. A combination of different statistical potentials and structural features using support vector machines is shown to provide somewhat improved performance over published methods.},

@article{Cozzetto2007aa,
	Abstract = {The article presents our evaluation of the predictions submitted to the model quality assessment (QA) category in CASP7. In this newly introduced category, predictors were asked to provide quality estimates for protein structure models. The QA category uses the automatically produced models that are traditionally distributed to CASP participants as input for predictions. Predictors were asked to provide an index of the quality of these individual models (QM1) as well as an index for the expected correctness of each of their residues (QM2). We computed the correlation between the observed and predicted quality of the models and of the individual residues achieved by the participating groups and evaluated the statistical significance of the differences. We also compared the results with those obtained by a "naive predictor" that assigns a quality score related to how close the model is to the structure of the most similar protein of known structure. The aims of a method for assessing the overall quality of a model can be twofold: selecting the best (or one of the best) model(s) among a set of plausible choices, or assigning a nonrelative quality value to an individual model. The applications of the two strategies are different, albeit equally important. Our assessment of the QA category demonstrates that methods for addressing the first task effectively do exist, while there is room for improvement as far as the second aspect is concerned. Notwithstanding the limited number of groups submitting predictions for residue-level accuracy, our data demonstrate that a respectable accuracy in this task can be achieved by methods relying on the comparison of different models for the same target.},

@article{McGuffin2007aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Selecting the highest quality 3D model of a protein structure from a number of alternatives remains an important challenge in the field of structural bioinformatics. Many Model Quality Assessment Programs (MQAPs) have been developed which adopt various strategies in order to tackle this problem, ranging from the so called "true" MQAPs capable of producing a single energy score based on a single model, to methods which rely on structural comparisons of multiple models or additional information from meta-servers. However, it is clear that no current method can separate the highest accuracy models from the lowest consistently. In this paper, a number of the top performing MQAP methods are benchmarked in the context of the potential value that they add to protein fold recognition. Two novel methods are also described: ModSSEA, which based on the alignment of predicted secondary structure elements and ModFOLD which combines several true MQAP methods using an artificial neural network. RESULTS: The ModSSEA method is found to be an effective model quality assessment program for ranking multiple models from many servers, however further accuracy can be gained by using the consensus approach of ModFOLD. The ModFOLD method is shown to significantly outperform the true MQAPs tested and is competitive with methods which make use of clustering or additional information from multiple servers. Several of the true MQAPs are also shown to add value to most individual fold recognition servers by improving model selection, when applied as a post filter in order to re-rank models. CONCLUSION: MQAPs should be benchmarked appropriately for the practical context in which they are intended to be used. Clustering based methods are the top performing MQAPs where many models are available from many servers; however, they often do not add value to individual fold recognition servers when limited models are available. Conversely, the true MQAP methods tested can often be used as effective post filters for re-ranking few models from individual fold recognition servers and further improvements can be achieved using a consensus of these methods.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prediction of protein structures is one of the fundamental challenges in biology today. To fully understand how well different prediction methods perform, it is necessary to use measures that evaluate their performance. Every two years, starting in 1994, the CASP (Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction) process has been organized to evaluate the ability of different predictors to blindly predict the structure of proteins. To capture different features of the models, several measures have been developed during the CASP processes. However, these measures have not been examined in detail before. In an attempt to develop fully automatic measures that can be used in CASP, as well as in other type of benchmarking experiments, we have compared twenty-one measures. These measures include the measures used in CASP3 and CASP2 as well as have measures introduced later. We have studied their ability to distinguish between the better and worse models submitted to CASP3 and the correlation between them. RESULTS: Using a small set of 1340 models for 23 different targets we show that most methods correlate with each other. Most pairs of measures show a correlation coefficient of about 0.5. The correlation is slightly higher for measures of similar types. We found that a significant problem when developing automatic measures is how to deal with proteins of different length. Also the comparisons between different measures is complicated as many measures are dependent on the size of the target. We show that the manual assessment can be reproduced to about 70% using automatic measures. Alignment independent measures, detects slightly more of the models with the correct fold, while alignment dependent measures agree better when selecting the best models for each target. Finally we show that using automatic measures would, to a large extent, reproduce the assessors ranking of the predictors at CASP3. CONCLUSIONS: We show that given a sufficient number of targets the manual and automatic measures would have given almost identical results at CASP3. If the intent is to reproduce the type of scoring done by the manual assessor in in CASP3, the best approach might be to use a combination of alignment independent and alignment dependent measures, as used in several recent studies.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The development and improvement of reliable computational methods designed to evaluate the quality of protein models is relevant in the context of protein structure refinement, which has been recently identified as one of the bottlenecks limiting the quality and usefulness of protein structure prediction. RESULTS: In this contribution, we present a computational method (Artificial Intelligence Decoys Evaluator: AIDE) which is able to consistently discriminate between correct and incorrect protein models. In particular, the method is based on neural networks that use as input 15 structural parameters, which include energy, solvent accessible surface, hydrophobic contacts and secondary structure content. The results obtained with AIDE on a set of decoy structures were evaluated using statistical indicators such as Pearson correlation coefficients, Znat, fraction enrichment, as well as ROC plots. It turned out that AIDE performances are comparable and often complementary to available state-of-the-art learning-based methods. CONCLUSION: In light of the results obtained with AIDE, as well as its comparison with available learning-based methods, it can be concluded that AIDE can be successfully used to evaluate the quality of protein structures. The use of AIDE in combination with other evaluation tools is expected to further enhance protein refinement efforts.},

	Abstract = {There has recently been an explosion in the number of structure-derived potential functions that are based on the increasing number of high-resolution protein crystal structures. These functions differ principally in their reference states; the usual two classes correspond either to initial solvent exposure or to residue exposure of residues. Reference states are critically important for applications of these potentials functions. Inspection of the potential functions and their derivation can tell us not only about protein interaction strengths themselves, but can also provide suggestions for the design of better folding simulations. An appropriate goal in this field is achieving self-consistency between the details in the derivation of potentials and the applied simulations.},

@article{Sippl1996aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Proteins fold to unique three-dimensional structures, but how they achieve this transition and how they maintain their native folds is controversial. Information on the functional form of molecular interactions is required to address these issues. The basic building blocks are the free energies of atom pair interactions in dense protein solvent systems. In a dense medium, entropic effects often dominate over internal energies but free energy estimates are notoriously difficult to obtain. A prominent example is the peptide hydrogen bond (H-bond). It is still unclear to what extent H-bonds contribute to protein folding and stability of native structures. RESULTS: Radial distribution functions of atom pair interactions are compiled from a database of known protein folds. The functions are transformed to Helmholtz free energies using a recipe from the statistical mechanics of dense interacting systems. In particular we concentrate on the features of the free energy functions of peptide H-bonds. Differences in Helmholtz free energies correspond to the reversible work required or gained when the distance between two particles is changed. Consequently, the functions directly display the energetic features of the respective thermodynamic process, such as H-bond formation or disruption. CONCLUSIONS: In the H-bond potential, a high barrier isolates a deep narrow minimum at H-bond contact from large distances, but the free energy difference between H-bond contact and large distances is close to zero. The energy barrier plays an intriguing role in H-bond formation and disruption: both processes require activation energy in the order of 2kT. H-bond formation opposes folding to compact states, but once formed, H-bonds act as molecular locks and a network of such bonds keeps polypeptide chains in a precise spatial configuration. On the other hand, peptide H-bonds do not contribute to the thermodynamic stability of native folds, because the energy balance of H-bond formation is close to zero.},

@article{Rose2006aa,
	Abstract = {Under physiological conditions, a protein undergoes a spontaneous disorder order transition called "folding." The protein polymer is highly flexible when unfolded but adopts its unique native, three-dimensional structure when folded. Current experimental knowledge comes primarily from thermodynamic measurements in solution or the structures of individual molecules, elucidated by either x-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy. From the former, we know the enthalpy, entropy, and free energy differences between the folded and unfolded forms of hundreds of proteins under a variety of solvent/cosolvent conditions. From the latter, we know the structures of approximately 35,000 proteins, which are built on scaffolds of hydrogen-bonded structural elements, alpha-helix and beta-sheet. Anfinsen showed that the amino acid sequence alone is sufficient to determine a protein's structure, but the molecular mechanism responsible for self-assembly remains an open question, probably the most fundamental open question in biochemistry. This perspective is a hybrid: partly review, partly proposal. First, we summarize key ideas regarding protein folding developed over the past half-century and culminating in the current mindset. In this view, the energetics of side-chain interactions dominate the folding process, driving the chain to self-organize under folding conditions. Next, having taken stock, we propose an alternative model that inverts the prevailing side-chain/backbone paradigm. Here, the energetics of backbone hydrogen bonds dominate the folding process, with preorganization in the unfolded state. Then, under folding conditions, the resultant fold is selected from a limited repertoire of structural possibilities, each corresponding to a distinct hydrogen-bonded arrangement of alpha-helices and/or strands of beta-sheet.},

	Abstract = {Reliable prediction of model accuracy is an important unsolved problem in protein structure modeling. To address this problem, we studied 24 individual assessment scores, including physics-based energy functions, statistical potentials, and machine learning-based scoring functions. Individual scores were also used to construct approximately 85,000 composite scoring functions using support vector machine (SVM) regression. The scores were tested for their abilities to identify the most native-like models from a set of 6000 comparative models of 20 representative protein structures. Each of the 20 targets was modeled using a template of <30% sequence identity, corresponding to challenging comparative modeling cases. The best SVM score outperformed all individual scores by decreasing the average RMSD difference between the model identified as the best of the set and the model with the lowest RMSD (DeltaRMSD) from 0.63 A to 0.45 A, while having a higher Pearson correlation coefficient to RMSD (r=0.87) than any other tested score. The most accurate score is based on a combination of the DOPE non-hydrogen atom statistical potential; surface, contact, and combined statistical potentials from MODPIPE; and two PSIPRED/DSSP scores. It was implemented in the SVMod program, which can now be applied to select the final model in various modeling problems, including fold assignment, target-template alignment, and loop modeling.},

	Abstract = {A two-stage neural network has been used to predict protein secondary structure based on the position specific scoring matrices generated by PSI-BLAST. Despite the simplicity and convenience of the approach used, the results are found to be superior to those produced by other methods, including the popular PHD method according to our own benchmarking results and the results from the recent Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction experiment (CASP3), where the method was evaluated by stringent blind testing. Using a new testing set based on a set of 187 unique folds, and three-way cross-validation based on structural similarity criteria rather than sequence similarity criteria used previously (no similar folds were present in both the testing and training sets) the method presented here (PSIPRED) achieved an average Q3 score of between 76.5% to 78.3% depending on the precise definition of observed secondary structure used, which is the highest published score for any method to date. Given the success of the method in CASP3, it is reasonable to be confident that the evaluation presented here gives a fair indication of the performance of the method in general.},

@article{Lee2007aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: For successful protein structure prediction by comparative modeling, in addition to identifying a good template protein with known structure, obtaining an accurate sequence alignment between a query protein and a template protein is critical. It has been known that the alignment accuracy can vary significantly depending on our choice of various alignment parameters such as gap opening penalty and gap extension penalty. Because the accuracy of sequence alignment is typically measured by comparing it with its corresponding structure alignment, there is no good way of evaluating alignment accuracy without knowing the structure of a query protein, which is obviously not available at the time of structure prediction. Moreover, there is no universal alignment parameter option that would always yield the optimal alignment. RESULTS: In this work, we develop a method to predict the quality of the alignment between a query and a template. We train the support vector regression (SVR) models to predict the MaxSub scores as a measure of alignment quality. The alignment between a query protein and a template of length n is transformed into a (n + 1)-dimensional feature vector, then it is used as an input to predict the alignment quality by the trained SVR model. Performance of our work is evaluated by various measures including Pearson correlation coefficient between the observed and predicted MaxSub scores. Result shows high correlation coefficient of 0.945. For a pair of query and template, 48 alignments are generated by changing alignment options. Trained SVR models are then applied to predict the MaxSub scores of those and to select the best alignment option which is chosen specifically to the query-template pair. This adaptive selection procedure results in 7.4% improvement of MaxSub scores, compared to those when the single best parameter option is used for all query-template pairs. CONCLUSION: The present work demonstrates that the alignment quality can be predicted with reasonable accuracy. Our method is useful not only for selecting the optimal alignment parameters for a chosen template based on predicted alignment quality, but also for filtering out problematic templates that are not suitable for structure prediction due to poor alignment accuracy. This is implemented as a part in FORECAST, the server for fold-recognition and is freely available on the web at http://pbil.kaist.ac.kr/forecast.},

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: The ability of a simple method (MODCHECK) to determine the sequence-structure compatibility of a set of structural models generated by fold recognition is tested in a thorough benchmark analysis. Four Model Quality Assessment Programs (MQAPs) were tested on 188 targets from the latest LiveBench-9 automated structure evaluation experiment. We systematically test and evaluate whether the MQAP methods can successfully detect native-like models. RESULTS: We show that compared with the other three methods tested MODCHECK is the most reliable method for consistently performing the best top model selection and for ranking the models. In addition, we show that the choice of model similarity score used to assess a model's similarity to the experimental structure can influence the overall performance of these tools. Although these MQAP methods fail to improve the model selection performance for methods that already incorporate protein three dimension (3D) structural information, an improvement is observed for methods that are purely sequence-based, including the best profile-profile methods. This suggests that even the best sequence-based fold recognition methods can still be improved by taking into account the 3D structural information. CONTACT: d.jones@cs.ucl.ac.uk},

	Abstract = {In protein structure prediction, a considerable number of alternative models are usually produced from which subsequently the final model has to be selected. Thus, a scoring function for the identification of the best model within an ensemble of alternative models is a key component of most protein structure prediction pipelines. QMEAN, which stands for Qualitative Model Energy ANalysis, is a composite scoring function describing the major geometrical aspects of protein structures. Five different structural descriptors are used. The local geometry is analyzed by a new kind of torsion angle potential over three consecutive amino acids. A secondary structure-specific distance-dependent pairwise residue-level potential is used to assess long-range interactions. A solvation potential describes the burial status of the residues. Two simple terms describing the agreement of predicted and calculated secondary structure and solvent accessibility, respectively, are also included. A variety of different implementations are investigated and several approaches to combine and optimize them are discussed. QMEAN was tested on several standard decoy sets including a molecular dynamics simulation decoy set as well as on a comprehensive data set of totally 22,420 models from server predictions for the 95 targets of CASP7. In a comparison to five well-established model quality assessment programs, QMEAN shows a statistically significant improvement over nearly all quality measures describing the ability of the scoring function to identify the native structure and to discriminate good from bad models. The three-residue torsion angle potential turned out to be very effective in recognizing the native fold.},

@article{Bahar1997aa,
	Abstract = {Residue-specific potentials between pairs of side-chains and pairs of side-chain-backbone interaction sites have been generated by collecting radial distribution data for 302 protein structures. Multiple atomic interactions have been utilized to enhance the specificity and smooth the distance-dependence of the potentials. The potentials are demonstrated to successfully discriminate correct sequences in inverse folding experiments. Many specific effects are observable in the non-bonded potentials; grouping of residue types is inappropriate, since each residue type manifests some unique behavior. Only a weak dependence is seen on protein size and composition. Effective contact potentials operating in three different environments (self, solvent-exposed and residue-exposed) and over any distance range are presented. The effective contact potentials obtained from the integration of radial distributions over the distance interval r < or = 6.4 A are in excellent agreement with published values. The hydrophobic interactions are verified to be dominantly strong in this range. Comparison of these with a newly derived set of effective contact potentials for closer inter-residue separations (r < or = 4.0 A) demonstrates drastic changes in the most favorable interactions. In the closer approach case, where the number of pairs with a given residue is approximately one, the highly specific interactions between charged and polar side-chains predominate. These closer approach values could be utilized to select successively the relative positions and directions of residue side-chains in protein simulations, following a hierarchical algorithm optimizing side-chain-side-chain interactions over the two successively closer distance ranges. The homogeneous contribution to stability is stronger than the specific contribution by about a factor of 5. Overall, the total non-bonded interaction energy calculated for individual proteins follows a dependence on the number of residues of the form of n1.28, indicating an enhanced stability for larger proteins.},

@article{Lazaridis1999aa,
	Abstract = {An essential requirement for theoretical protein structure prediction is an energy function that can discriminate the native from non-native protein conformations. To date most of the energy functions used for this purpose have been extracted from a statistical analysis of the protein structure database, without explicit reference to the physical interactions responsible for protein stability. The use of the statistical functions has been supported by the widespread belief that they are superior for such discrimination to physics-based energy functions. An effective energy function which combined the CHARMM vacuum potential with a Gaussian model for the solvation free energy is tested for its ability to discriminate the native structure of a protein from misfolded conformations; the results are compared with those obtained with the vacuum CHARMM potential. The test is performed on several sets of misfolded structures prepared by others, including sets of about 650 good decoys for six proteins, as well as on misfolded structures of chymotrypsin inhibitor 2. The vacuum CHARMM potential is successful in most cases when energy minimized conformations are considered, but fails when applied to structures relaxed by molecular dynamics. With the effective energy function the native state is always more stable than grossly misfolded conformations both in energy minimized and molecular dynamics-relaxed structures. The present results suggest that molecular mechanics (physics-based) energy functions, complemented by a simple model for the solvation free energy, should be tested for use in the inverse folding problem, and supports their use in studies of the effective energy surface of proteins in solution. Moreover, the study suggests that the belief in the superiority of statistical functions for these purposes may be ill founded.},

In the last decade, several attempts have been made to merge atomic detail molecular dynamics simulations with solvent continuum models. Among continuum models, the Poisson-Boltzmann solvent accessible surface area model is one of the oldest and most fundamental. Notwithstanding its wide usage for simulation of biomolecular electrostatic potential, the Poisson-Boltzmann equation has been very seldom used to obtain solvation forces for molecular dynamics simulation. We propose here a fast and reliable methodology to implement continuum forces in standard molecular mechanics and dynamics algorithms. Results for a totally unrestrained 1 ns molecular dynamics simulation of a small protein are quantitatively similar to results obtained by explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations.},

Here we present several examples of the relations between PFAM protein families that were detected by COMPASS and that lead to the predictions of presently unresolved protein structures. We discuss relatively straightforward COMPASS predictions that are new and interesting to us, and that would require a substantial time and effort to justify even for a skilled PSI-BLAST user. All of the presented COMPASS hits are independently confirmed by other methods, including the ab initio structure-prediction method ROSETTA. The tertiary structure predictions made by ROSETTA proved to be useful for improving sequence-derived alignments, because they are based on a reasonable folding of the polypeptide chain rather than on the information from sequence databases. The ability of COMPASS to predict new relations within the PFAM database indicates the high sensitivity of COMPASS searches and substantiates its potential value for the discovery of previously unknown similarities between protein families.},

@article{Sippl1990aa,
	Abstract = {We present a prototype of a new approach to the folding problem of polypeptide chains. This approach is based on the analysis of known protein structures. It derives the energy potentials for the atomic interactions of all amino acid residue pairs as a function of the distance between the involved atoms. These potentials are then used to calculate the energies of all conformations that exist in the data base with respect to a given sequence. Then, by using only the most stable conformations, clusters of the most probable conformations for the given sequence are obtained. To discuss the results properly we introduce a new classification of segments based on their conformational stability. Special care is taken to allow for sparse data sets. The use of the method is demonstrated in the discussion of the identical oligopeptide sequences found in different conformations in unrelated proteins. VNTFV, for example, adopts a beta-strand in ribonuclease but it is found in an alpha-helical conformation in erythrocruorin. In the case of VNTFV the ensemble obtained consists of a single cluster of beta-strand conformations, indicating that this may be the preferred conformation for the pentapeptide. When the flanking residues are included in the calculation the hepapeptide P-VNTFV-H (ribonuclease) again yields an ensemble of beta-strands. However, in the ensemble of D-VNTFV-A (erythrocruorin) the major cluster is of alpha-helical type. In the present study we concentrate on the local aspects of protein conformations. However, the theory presented is quite general and not restricted to oligopeptides. We indicate extensions of the approach to the calculation of global conformations of proteins as well as conceivable applications to a number of molecular systems.},

	Abstract = {The prediction of protein tertiary structure from sequence using molecular energy calculations has not yet been successful; an alternative strategy of recognizing known motifs or folds in sequences looks more promising. We present here a new approach to fold recognition, whereby sequences are fitted directly onto the backbone coordinates of known protein structures. Our method for protein fold recognition involves automatic modelling of protein structures using a given sequence, and is based on the frameworks of known protein folds. The plausibility of each model, and hence the degree of compatibility between the sequence and the proposed structure, is evaluated by means of a set of empirical potentials derived from proteins of known structure. The novel aspect of our approach is that the matching of sequences to backbone coordinates is performed in full three-dimensional space, incorporating specific pair interactions explicitly.},

The environments are described by: (i) the area of the residue buried in the protein and inaccessible to solvent; (ii) the fraction of side-chain area that is covered by polar atoms (O and N); and (iii) the local secondary structure. Examples of this 3D profile method are presented for four families of proteins: the globins, cyclic AMP (adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate) receptor-like proteins, the periplasmic binding proteins, and the actins. This method is able to detect the structural similarity of the actins and 70- kilodalton heat shock proteins, even though these protein families share no detectable sequence similarity.},

The FASTA program is a more sensitive derivative of the FASTP program, which can be used to search protein or DNA sequence data bases and can compare a protein sequence to a DNA sequence data base by translating the DNA data base as it is searched. FASTA includes an additional step in the calculation of the initial pairwise similarity score that allows multiple regions of similarity to be joined to increase the score of related sequences. The RDF2 program can be used to evaluate the significance of similarity scores using a shuffling method that preserves local sequence composition. The LFASTA program can display all the regions of local similarity between two sequences with scores greater than a threshold, using the same scoring parameters and a similar alignment algorithm; these local similarities can be displayed as a "graphic matrix" plot or as individual alignments. In addition, these programs have been generalized to allow comparison of DNA or protein sequences based on a variety of alternative scoring matrices.},

A new criterion for triggering the extension of word hits, combined with a new heuristic for generating gapped alignments, yields a gapped BLAST program that runs at approximately three times the speed of the original. In addition, a method is introduced for automatically combining statistically significant alignments produced by BLAST into a position-specific score matrix, and searching the database using this matrix. The resulting Position-Specific Iterated BLAST (PSI-BLAST) program runs at approximately the same speed per iteration as gapped BLAST, but in many cases is much more sensitive to weak but biologically relevant sequence similarities.

	Abstract = {The recently developed TASSER (Threading/ASSembly/Refinement) method is applied to predict the tertiary structures of all CASP6 targets. TASSER is a hierarchical approach that consists of template identification by the threading program PROSPECTOR_3, followed by tertiary structure assembly via rearranging continuous template fragments. Assembly occurs using parallel hyperbolic Monte Carlo sampling under the guide of an optimized, reduced force field that includes knowledge-based statistical potentials and spatial restraints extracted from threading alignments. Models are automatically selected from the Monte Carlo trajectories in the low-temperature replicas using the clustering program SPICKER. For all 90 CASP targets/domains, PROSPECTOR_3 generates initial alignments with an average root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) to native of 8.4 A with 79% coverage. After TASSER reassembly, the average RMSD decreases to 5.4 A over the same aligned residues; the overall cumulative TM-score increases from 39.44 to 52.53. Despite significant improvements over the PROSPECTOR_3 template alignment observed in all target categories, the overall quality of the final models is essentially dictated by the quality of threading templates: The average TM-scores of TASSER models in the three categories are, respectively, 0.79 [comparative modeling (CM), 43 targets/domains], 0.47 [fold recognition (FR), 37 targets/domains], and 0.30 [new fold (NF), 10 targets/domains]. This highlights the need to develop novel (or improved) approaches to identify very distant targets as well as better NF algorithms.},

	Abstract = {We have developed a new combined approach for ab initio protein structure prediction. The protein conformation is described as a lattice chain connecting C(alpha) atoms, with attached C(beta) atoms and side-chain centers of mass. The model force field includes various short-range and long-range knowledge-based potentials derived from a statistical analysis of the regularities of protein structures. The combination of these energy terms is optimized through the maximization of correlation for 30 x 60,000 decoys between the root mean square deviation (RMSD) to native and energies, as well as the energy gap between native and the decoy ensemble. To accelerate the conformational search, a newly developed parallel hyperbolic sampling algorithm with a composite movement set is used in the Monte Carlo simulation processes. We exploit this strategy to successfully fold 41/100 small proteins (36 approximately 120 residues) with predicted structures having a RMSD from native below 6.5 A in the top five cluster centroids. To fold larger-size proteins as well as to improve the folding yield of small proteins, we incorporate into the basic force field side-chain contact predictions from our threading program PROSPECTOR where homologous proteins were excluded from the data base. With these threading-based restraints, the program can fold 83/125 test proteins (36 approximately 174 residues) with structures having a RMSD to native below 6.5 A in the top five cluster centroids. This shows the significant improvement of folding by using predicted tertiary restraints, especially when the accuracy of side-chain contact prediction is >20%. For native fold selection, we introduce quantities dependent on the cluster density and the combination of energy and free energy, which show a higher discriminative power to select the native structure than the previously used cluster energy or cluster size, and which can be used in native structure identification in blind simulations. These procedures are readily automated and are being implemented on a genomic scale.},

	Abstract = {We present our predictions in the ab initio structure prediction category of CASP3. Eleven targets were folded, using a method based on a Monte Carlo search driven by secondary and tertiary restraints derived from multiple sequence alignments. Our results can be qualitatively summarized as follows: The global fold can be considered "correct" for targets 65 and 74, "almost correct" for targets 64, 75, and 77, "half-correct" for target 79, and "wrong" for targets 52, 56, 59, and 63. Target 72 has not yet been solved experimentally. On average, for small helical and alpha/beta proteins (on the order of 110 residues or smaller), the method predicted low resolution structures with a reasonably good prediction of the global topology. Most encouraging is that in some situations, such as with target 75 and, particularly, target 77, the method can predict a substantial portion of a rare or even a novel fold. However, the current method still fails on some beta proteins, proteins over the 110-residue threshold, and sequences in which only a poor multiple sequence alignment can be built. On the other hand, for small proteins, the method gives results of quality at least similar to that of threading, with the advantage of not being restricted to known folds in the protein database. Overall, these results indicate that some progress has been made on the ab initio protein folding problem. Detailed information about our results can be obtained by connecting to http:/(/)www.bioinformatics.danforthcenter.org/+ ++CASP3.},

To estimate the reliability of the predictions, the method was calibrated on 131 proteins of known structure. For approximately 60% of the proteins one of the top five models was correctly predicted for 50 or more residues, and for approximately 35%, the correct SCOP superfamily was identified in a structure-based search of the Protein Data Bank using one of the models. This performance is consistent with results from the fourth critical assessment of structure prediction (CASP4). Correct and incorrect predictions could be partially distinguished using a confidence function based on a combination of simulation convergence, protein length and the similarity of a given structure prediction to known protein structures. While the limited accuracy and reliability of the method precludes definitive conclusions, the Pfam models provide the only tertiary structure information available for the 12% of publicly available sequences represented by these large protein families.},

	Abstract = {We explore the ability of a simple simulated annealing procedure to assemble native-like structures from fragments of unrelated protein structures with similar local sequences using Bayesian scoring functions. Environment and residue pair specific contributions to the scoring functions appear as the first two terms in a series expansion for the residue probability distributions in the protein database; the decoupling of the distance and environment dependencies of the distributions resolves the major problems with current database-derived scoring functions noted by Thomas and Dill. The simulated annealing procedure rapidly and frequently generates native-like structures for small helical proteins and better than random structures for small beta sheet containing proteins. Most of the simulated structures have native-like solvent accessibility and secondary structure patterns, and thus ensembles of these structures provide a particularly challenging set of decoys for evaluating scoring functions. We investigate the effects of multiple sequence information and different types of conformational constraints on the overall performance of the method, and the ability of a variety of recently developed scoring functions to recognize the native-like conformations in the ensembles of simulated structures.},

	Abstract = {Structural genomics has as its goal the provision of structural information for all possible ORF sequences through a combination of experimental and computational approaches. The access to genome sequences and cloning resources from an ever-widening array of organisms is driving high-throughput structural studies by the New York Structural Genomics Research Consortium. In this report, we outline the progress of the Consortium in establishing its pipeline for structural genomics, and some of the experimental and bioinformatics efforts leading to structural annotation of proteins. The Consortium has established a pipeline for structural biology studies, automated modeling of ORF sequences using solved (template) structures, and a novel high-throughput approach (metallomics) to examining the metal binding to purified protein targets. The Consortium has so far produced 493 purified proteins from >1077 expression vectors. A total of 95 have resulted in crystal structures, and 81 are deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Comparative modeling of these structures has generated >40,000 structural models. We also initiated a high-throughput metal analysis of the purified proteins; this has determined that 10%-15% of the targets contain a stoichiometric structural or catalytic transition metal atom. The progress of the structural genomics centers in the U.S. and around the world suggests that the goal of providing useful structural information on most all ORF domains will be realized. This projected resource will provide structural biology information important to understanding the function of most proteins of the cell.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Experimentally determined protein structures may contain errors and require validation. Conformational criteria based on the Ramachandran plot are mainly used to distinguish between distorted and adequately refined models. While the readily available criteria are sufficient to detect totally wrong structures, establishing the more subtle differences between plausible structures remains more challenging. RESULTS: A new criterion, called TAP score, measuring local sequence to structure fitness based on torsion angle propensities normalized against the global minimum and maximum is introduced. It is shown to be more accurate than previous methods at estimating the validity of a protein model in terms of commonly used experimental quality parameters on two test sets representing the full PDB database and a subset of obsolete PDB structures. Highly selective TAP thresholds are derived to recognize over 90% of the top experimental structures in the absence of experimental information. Both a web server and an executable version of the TAP score are available at http://protein.cribi.unipd.it/tap/. CONCLUSION: A novel procedure for energy normalization (TAP) has significantly improved the possibility to recognize the best experimental structures. It will allow the user to more reliably isolate problematic structures in the context of automated experimental structure determination.},

	Abstract = {We have analysed the frequency with which potential hydrogen bond donors and acceptors are satisfied in protein molecules. There are a small percentage of nitrogen or oxygen atoms that do not form hydrogen bonds with either solvent or protein atoms, when standard criteria are used. For high resolution structures 9.5% and 5.1% of buried main-chain nitrogen and oxygen atoms, respectively, fail to hydrogen bond under our standard criteria, representing 5.8% and 2.1% of all main-chain nitrogen and oxygen atoms. We find that as the resolution of the data improves, the percentages fall. If the hydrogen bond criteria are relaxed many of these unsatisfied atoms form weak hydrogen bonds. However, there remain some buried atoms (1.3% NH and 1.8% CO) that fail to hydrogen bond without any immediately obvious compensating interactions.},

	Abstract = {Protein structure prediction is an important problem of both intellectual and practical interest. Most protein structure prediction approaches generate multiple candidate models first, and then use a scoring function to select the best model among these candidates. In this work, we develop a scoring function using support vector regression (SVR). Both consensus-based features and features from individual structures are extracted from a training data set containing native protein structures and predicted structural models submitted to CASP5 and CASP6. The SVR learns a scoring function that is a linear combination of these features. We test this scoring function on two data sets. First, when used to rank server models submitted to CASP7, the SVR score selects predictions that are comparable to the best performing server in CASP7, Zhang-Server, and significantly better than all the other servers. Even if the SVR score is not allowed to select Zhang-Server models, the SVR score still selects predictions that are significantly better than all the other servers. In addition, the SVR is able to select significantly better models and yield significantly better Pearson correlation coefficients than the two best Quality Assessment groups in CASP7, QA556 (LEE), and QA634 (Pcons). Second, this work aims to improve the ability of the Robetta server to select best models, and hence we evaluate the performance of the SVR score on ranking the Robetta server template-based models for the CASP7 targets. The SVR selects significantly better models than the Robetta K*Sync consensus alignment score.},

They can be divided into three categories based on the information they use. Consensus based methods use the similarity to other models, structure-based methods use features calculated from the structure and evolutionary based methods use the sequence similarity between a model and a template. These methods can be trained to predict the overall global quality of a model, that is, how much a model is likely to differ from the native structure. The methods can also be trained to pinpoint which local regions in a model are likely to be incorrect. In CASP7, we participated with three predictors of global and four of local quality using information from the three categories described above. The result shows that the MQAP using consensus, Pcons, was significantly better at predicting both global and local quality compared with MQAPs using only structure or sequence based information.},

@article{Lundstrom2001,
	Abstract = {During recent years many protein fold recognition methods have been developed, based on different algorithms and using various kinds of information. To examine the performance of these methods several evaluation experiments have been conducted. These include blind tests in CASP/CAFASP, large scale benchmarks, and long-term, continuous assessment with newly solved protein structures. These studies confirm the expectation that for different targets different methods produce the best predictions, and the final prediction accuracy could be improved if the available methods were combined in a perfect manner. In this article a neural-network-based consensus predictor, Pcons, is presented that attempts this task. Pcons attempts to select the best model out of those produced by six prediction servers, each using different methods. Pcons translates the confidence scores reported by each server into uniformly scaled values corresponding to the expected accuracy of each model. The translated scores as well as the similarity between models produced by different servers is used in the final selection. According to the analysis based on two unrelated sets of newly solved proteins, Pcons outperforms any single server by generating approximately 8%-10% more correct predictions. Furthermore, the specificity of Pcons is significantly higher than for any individual server. From analyzing different input data to Pcons it can be shown that the improvement is mainly attributable to measurement of the similarity between the different models. Pcons is freely accessible for the academic community through the protein structure-prediction metaserver at http://bioinfo.pl/meta/.},

The goal for the development of the 3D-Jury system is to create a simple but powerful procedure for generating meta-predictions using variable sets of models obtained from diverse sources. The resulting protocol should help to improve the quality of structural annotations of novel proteins. Results: The 3D-Jury system generates meta-predictions from sets of models created using variable methods. It is not necessary to know prior characteristics of the methods. The system is able to utilize immediately new components (additional prediction providers). The accuracy of the system is comparable with other well-tuned prediction servers. The algorithm resembles methods of selecting models generated using ab initio folding simulations. It is simple and offers a portable solution to improve the accuracy of other protein structure prediction protocols.

Second, rather than setting specific distance cutoffs and calculating only the fractions with errors below the cutoff, all residue pairs in alignment/modeling are evaluated in the proposed score. For comparison of various scoring functions, we have constructed a large-scale benchmark set of structure templates for 1489 small to medium size proteins using the threading program PROSPECTOR_3 and built the full-length models using MODELLER and TASSER. The TM-score of the initial threading alignments, compared to the GDT and MaxSub scoring functions, shows a much stronger correlation to the quality of the final full-length models. The TM-score is further exploited as an assessment of all 'new fold' targets in the recent CASP5 experiment and shows a close coincidence with the results of human-expert visual assessment. These data suggest that the TM-score is a useful complement to the fully automated assessment of protein structure predictions.

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: Evaluating the accuracy of predicted models is critical for assessing structure prediction methods. Because this problem is not trivial, a large number of different assessment measures have been proposed by various authors, and it has already become an active subfield of research (Moult et al. (1997,1999) and CAFASP (Fischer et al. 1999) prediction experiments have demonstrated that it has been difficult to choose one single, 'best' method to be used in the evaluation. Consequently, the CASP3 evaluation was carried out using an extensive set of especially developed numerical measures, coupled with human-expert intervention. As part of our efforts towards a higher level of automation in the structure prediction field, here we investigate the suitability of a fully automated, simple, objective, quantitative and reproducible method that can be used in the automatic assessment of models in the upcoming CAFASP2 experiment. Such a method should (a) produce one single number that measures the quality of a predicted model and (b) perform similarly to human-expert evaluations. RESULTS: MaxSub is a new and independently developed method that further builds and extends some of the evaluation methods introduced at CASP3. MaxSub aims at identifying the largest subset of C(alpha) atoms of a model that superimpose 'well' over the experimental structure, and produces a single normalized score that represents the quality of the model. Because there exists no evaluation method for assessment measures of predicted models, it is not easy to evaluate how good our new measure is. Even though an exact comparison of MaxSub and the CASP3 assessment is not straightforward, here we use a test-bed extracted from the CASP3 fold-recognition models. A rough qualitative comparison of the performance of MaxSub vis-a-vis the human-expert assessment carried out at CASP3 shows that there is a good agreement for the more accurate models and for the better predicting groups. As expected, some differences were observed among the medium to poor models and groups. Overall, the top six predicting groups ranked using the fully automated MaxSub are also the top six groups ranked at CASP3. We conclude that MaxSub is a suitable method for the automatic evaluation of models.},

With homologues excluded, in 927 cases, the templates identified by our threading algorithm PROSPECTOR_3 have a rms deviation from native <6.5 A with approximately 80% alignment coverage. After template reassembly, this number increases to 1,172. This shows significant and systematic improvement of the final models with respect to the initial template alignments. Furthermore, significant improvements in loop modeling are demonstrated. We then apply TASSER to the 1,360 medium-sized ORFs in the Escherichia coli genome; approximately 920 can be predicted with high accuracy based on confidence criteria established in the Protein Data Bank benchmark. These results from our unprecedented comprehensive folding benchmark on all protein categories provide a reliable basis for the application of TASSER to structural genomics, especially to proteins of low sequence identity to solved protein structures.},

Under this metric, protein chains naturally separate into fold clusters. We use SGM to construct an automatic classification procedure for the CATH2.4 database. The method is very fast because it requires neither alignment of the chains nor any chain-chain comparison. It also has only one adjustable parameter. We assign 95.51% of the chains into the proper C (class), A (architecture), T (topology), and H (homologous superfamily) fold, find all new folds, and detect no false geometric positives. Using the SGM, we display a ``map'' of the space of folds projected onto two dimensions, show the relative locations of the major structural classes, and ``zoom into'' the space of proteins to show architecture, topology, and fold clusters.
