We identify DEPTOR as an mTOR-interacting protein whose expression is negatively regulated by mTORC1 and mTORC2. Loss of DEPTOR activates S6K1, Akt, and SGK1, promotes cell growth and survival, and activates mTORC1 and mTORC2 kinase activities. DEPTOR overexpression suppresses S6K1 but, by relieving feedback inhibition from mTORC1 to PI3K signaling, activates Akt. Consistent with many human cancers having activated mTORC1 and mTORC2 pathways, DEPTOR expression is low in most cancers. Surprisingly, DEPTOR is highly overexpressed in a subset of multiple myelomas harboring cyclin D1/D3 or c-MAF/MAFB translocations. In these cells, high DEPTOR expression is necessary to maintain PI3K and Akt activation and a reduction in DEPTOR levels leads to apoptosis. Thus, we identify a novel mTOR-interacting protein whose deregulated overexpression in multiple myeloma cells represents a mechanism for activating PI3K/Akt signaling and promoting cell survival.",

Upstream of mTOR key signalling molecules are the small GTPase Ras, the lipid kinase PI3K, the Akt kinase, and the GTPase Rheb, which are known to be deregulated in many human cancers. Mutations in the mTOR pathway component genes TSC1, TSC2, LKB1, PTEN, VHL, NF1 and PKD1 trigger the development of the syndromes tuberous sclerosis, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, Cowden syndrome, Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome, Lhermitte-Duclos disease, Proteus syndrome, von Hippel-Lindau disease, Neurofibromatosis type 1, and Polycystic kidney disease, respectively. In addition, the tuberous sclerosis proteins have been implicated in the development of several sporadic tumors and in the control of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27, known to be of relevance for several cancers. Recently, it has been recognized that mTOR is regulated by TNF- alpha and Wnt, both of which have been shown to play critical roles in the development of many human neoplasias. In addition to all these human diseases, the role of mTOR in Alzheimer's disease, cardiac hypertrophy, obesity and type 2 diabetes is discussed.",

	abstract = "Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) functions in two distinct signaling complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. In response to insulin and nutrients, mTORC1, consisting of mTOR, raptor (regulatory-associated protein of mTOR), and mLST8, is activated and phosphorylates eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4EBP) and p70 S6 kinase to promote protein synthesis and cell size. Previously we found that activation of mTOR kinase in response to insulin was associated with increased 4EBP1 binding to raptor. Here we identify prolinerich Akt substrate 40 (PRAS40) as a binding partner for mTORC1. A putative TOR signaling motif, FVMDE, is identified in PRAS40 and shown to be required for interaction with raptor. Insulin stimulation markedly decreases the level of PRAS40 bound by mTORC1. Recombinant PRAS40 inhibits mTORC1 kinase activity in vivo and in vitro, and this inhibition depends on PRAS40 association with raptor. Furthermore, decreasing PRAS40 expression by short hairpin RNA enhances 4E-BP1 binding to raptor, and recombinant PRAS40 competes with 4E-BP1 binding to raptor. We, therefore, propose that PRAS40 regulates mTORC1 kinase activity by functioning as a direct inhibitor of substrate binding.",

@article{Nascimento2010,
	abstract = "Type 2 diabetes is associated with alterations in protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signalling. The proline-rich Akt substrate of 40-kDa (PRAS40) is a component of mTORC1, which has a regulatory function at the intersection of the PKB/Akt and mTORC1 signalling pathway. Phosphorylation of PRAS40-Thr246 by PKB/Akt, and PRAS40-Ser183 and PRAS40-Ser221 by mTORC1 results in dissociation from mTORC1, and its binding to 14-3-3 proteins. Although all phosphorylation sites within PRAS40 have been implicated in 14-3-3 binding, substitution of Thr246 by Ala alone is sufficient to abolish 14-3-3 binding under conditions of intact mTORC1 signalling. This suggests that phosphorylation of PRAS40-Thr246 may facilitate efficient phosphorylation of PRAS40 on its mTORC1-dependent sites. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism of PRAS40-Ser183 phosphorylation in response to insulin. Insulin promoted PRAS40-Ser183 phosphorylation after a euglycaemic- hyperinsulinaemic clamp in human skeletal muscle. The insulin-induced PRAS40-Ser183 phosphorylation was further evidenced in vivo in rat skeletal and cardiac muscle, and in vitro in A14 fibroblasts, 3T3L1 adipocytes and L6 myotubes. Inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin or amino acid deprivation partially abrogated insulin-mediated PRAS40-Ser183 phosphorylation in cultured cell lines. However, lowering insulin-induced PRAS40-Thr246 phosphorylation using wortmannin or palmitate in cell lines, or by feeding rats a high-fat diet, completely abolished insulin-mediated PRAS40-Ser183 phosphorylation. In addition, replacement of Thr246 by Ala reduced insulin-mediated PRAS40-Ser183 phosphorylation. We conclude that PRAS40-Ser183 is a component of insulin action, and that efficient phosphorylation of PRAS40-Ser183 by mTORC1 requires the phosphorylation of PRAS40-Thr246 by PKB/Akt.",

	abstract = "Akt/PKB is a critical regulator of cardiac function and morphology, and its activity is governed by dual phosphorylation at active loop (Thr308) by phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) and at carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic motif (Ser473) by a putative PDK2. P21-activated kinase-1 (Pak1) is a serine/threonine protein kinase implicated in the regulation of cardiac hypertrophy and contractility and was shown previously to activate Akt through an undefined mechanism. Here we report Pak1 as a potential PDK2 that is essential for Akt activity in cardiomyocytes. Both Pak1 and Akt can be activated by multiple hypertrophic stimuli or growth factors in a phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent manner. Pak1 overexpression induces Akt phosphorylation at both Ser473 and Thr308 in cardiomyocytes. Conversely, silencing or inactivating Pak1 gene diminishes Akt phosphorylation in vitro and in vivo. Purified Pak1 can directly phosphorylate Akt only at Ser473, suggesting that Pak1 may be a relevant PDK2 responsible for AKT Ser473 phosphorylation in cardiomyocytes. In addition, Pak1 protects cardiomyocytes from cell death, which is blocked by Akt inhibition. Our results connect two important regulators of cellular physiological functions and provide a potential mechanism for Pak1 signaling in cardiomyocytes.",

The catalytic domain of serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated protein kinase (SGK) is 54\% identical with that of PKB and, although lacking the PtdIns(3,4, 5)P3-binding pleckstrin-homology domain, SGK retains the residues that are phosphorylated by PDK1 and PDK2, which are Thr256 and Ser422 in SGK. Here we show that PDK1 activates SGK in vitro by phosphorylating Thr256. We also show that, in response to insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) or hydrogen peroxide, transfected SGK is activated in 293 cells via a PtdIns 3-kinase-dependent pathway that involves the phosphorylation of Thr256 and Ser422. The activation of SGK by PDK1 in vitro is unaffected by PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, abolished by the mutation of Ser422 to Ala, and greatly potentiated by mutation of Ser422 to Asp ( although this mutation does not activate SGK itself). Consistent with these findings, the Ser422Asp mutant of SGK is activated by phosphorylation (probably at Thr256) in unstimulated 293 cells, and activation is unaffected by inhibitors of PtdIns 3-kinase. Our results are consistent with a model in which activation of SGK by IGF-1 or hydrogen peroxide is initiated by a PtdIns(3,4, 5)P3-dependent activation of PDK2, which phosphorylates Ser422. This is followed by the PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-independent phosphorylation at Thr256 that activates SGK, and is catalysed by PDK1. Like PKB, SGK preferentially phosphorylates serine and threonine residues that lie in Arg-Xaa-Arg-Xaa-Xaa-Ser/Thr motifs, and SGK and PKB inactivate glycogen synthase kinase-3 similarly in vitro and in co-transfection experiments. These findings raise the possibility that some physiological roles ascribed to PKB on the basis of the overexpression of constitutively active PKB mutants might be mediated by SGK.",

	abstract = "SGK1 (serum- and glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase 1) is a member of the AGC (protein kinase A/protein kinase G/protein kinase C) family of protein kinases and is activated by agonists including growth factors. SGK1 regulates diverse effects of extracellular agonists by phosphorylating regulatory proteins that control cellular processes such as ion transport and growth. Like other AGC family kinases, activation of SGK1 is triggered by phosphorylation of a threonine residue within the T-loop of the kinase domain and a serine residue lying within the C-terminal hydrophobic motif (Ser(422) in SGK1). PDK1 (phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1) phosphorylates the T-loop of SGK1. The identity of the hydrophobic motif kinase is unclear. Recent work has established that mTORC1 [mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) complex 1] phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of S6K (S6 kinase), whereas mTORC2 (mTOR complex 2) phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif of Akt (also known as protein kinase B). In the present study we demonstrate that SGK1 hydrophobic motif phosphorylation and activity is ablated in knockout fibroblasts possessing mTORC1 activity, but lacking the mTORC2 subunits rictor (rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR), Sin1 (stress-activated-protein-kinase-interacting protein 1) or mLST8 (mammalian lethal with SEC13 protein 8). Furthermore, phosphorylation of NDRG1 (N-myc downstream regulated gene 1), a physiological substrate of SGK1, was also abolished in rictor-, Sin1- or mLST8-deficient fibroblasts. mTORC2 immunoprecipitated from wild-type, but not from mLST8- or rictor-knockout cells, phosphorylated SGK1 at Ser(422). Consistent with mTORC1 not regulating SGK1, immunoprecipitated mTORC1 failed to phosphorylate SGK1 at Ser(422), under conditions which it phosphorylated the hydrophobic motif of S6K. Moreover, rapamycin treatment of HEK (human embryonic kidney)-293, MCF-7 or HeLa cells suppressed phosphorylation of S6K, without affecting SGK1 phosphorylation or activation. The findings of the present study indicate that mTORC2, but not mTORC1, plays a vital role in controlling the hydrophobic motif phosphorylation and activity of SGK1. Our findings may explain why in previous studies phosphorylation of substrates, such as FOXO (forkhead box O), that could be regulated by SGK, are reduced in mTORC2-deficient cells. The results of the present study indicate that NDRG1 phosphorylation represents an excellent biomarker for mTORC2 activity.",

Our aim was to determine p70S6K and PI3K/mTOR/p70S6K pathway dependent gene expression profiles by microarrays using five breast cancer cell lines with predefined gene copy number and gene expression alterations. The p70S6K dependent profiles were determined by siRNA silencing of RPS6KB1 in two breast cancer cell lines overexpressing p70S6K. These profiles were further correlated with gene expression alterations caused by inhibition of PI3K/mTOR pathway with PI3K inhibitor Ly294002 or mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. RESULTS: Altogether, the silencing of p70S6K altered the expression of 109 and 173 genes in two breast cancer cell lines and 67 genes were altered in both cell lines in addition to RPS6KB1. Furthermore, 17 genes including VTCN1 and CDKN2B showed overlap with genes differentially expressed after PI3K or mTOR inhibition. The gene expression signatures responsive to both PI3K/mTOR pathway and p70S6K inhibitions revealed previously unidentified genes suggesting novel downstream targets for PI3K/mTOR/p70S6K pathway. CONCLUSION: Since p70S6K overexpression is associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis of breast cancer patients, the potential downstream targets of p70S6K and the whole PI3K/mTOR/p70S6K pathway identified in our study may have diagnostic value.",

Here, we develop a dynamic model to identify the regulatory role of amino acids in mTOR activation and to study its effect on insulin signaling in relation to multiple feedback loops present in the insulin signaling pathway. The analysis revealed that amino acids bring about multiple effects in the regulation of mTOR that might be represented by a single mechanism. Insulin signaling was demonstrated to operate between two extreme conditions involving tumor growth and insulin resistance, with multiple feedback loops tightly controlling and maintaining a robust insulin response. The state of insulin resistance was characterized by a decrease in the time lag or an increase in the magnitude of the negative feedback loop facilitated through perturbations such as excess input of amino acids.

We exploit experimental and computational approaches to reveal how a concordant interplay between the insulin and epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling networks can potentiate mitogenic signaling. In HEK293 cells, insulin is a poor activator of the Ras/ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) cascade, yet it enhances ERK activation by low EGF doses. We find that major crosstalk mechanisms that amplify ERK signaling are localized upstream of Ras and at the Ras/Raf level. Computational modeling unveils how critical network nodes, the adaptor proteins GAB1 and insulin receptor substrate (IRS), Src kinase, and phosphatase SHP2, convert insulin-induced increase in the phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP(3)) concentration into enhanced Ras/ERK activity. The model predicts and experiments confirm that insulin-induced amplification of mitogenic signaling is abolished by disrupting PIP(3)-mediated positive feedback via GAB1 and IRS. We demonstrate that GAB1 behaves as a non-linear amplifier of mitogenic responses and insulin endows EGF signaling with robustness to GAB1 suppression.

Great endeavors have been made to elucidate the functions and regulation of mTOR in the past decade. The current prevailing view is that mTOR regulates many fundamental biological processes, such as cell growth and survival, by integrating both intracellular and extracellular signals, including growth factors, nutrients, energy levels, and cellular stress. The significance of mTOR has been highlighted most recently by the identification of mTOR-associated proteins. Amazingly, when bound to different proteins, mTOR forms distinctive complexes with very different physiological functions. These findings not only expand the roles that mTOR plays in cells but also further complicate the regulation network. Thus, it is now even more critical that we precisely understand the underlying molecular mechanisms in order to directly guide the development and usage of anti-cancer drugs targeting the mTOR signaling pathway. In this review, we will discuss different mTOR-associated proteins, the regulation of mTOR complexes, and the consequences of mTOR dysregulation under pathophysiological conditions.",

Knowledge of the mTOR pathway is rapidly expanding. This review provides an update on the most recent additions to the mTOR pathway with particular emphasis on mTORC1 signalling. mTORC1 signalling is classically known for its role in regulating cell growth and proliferation through modulation of protein synthesis. Recent research has identified novel mTORC1 cell signalling mechanisms that modulate mitochondrial biogenesis, hypoxia signalling and cell cycle progression and uncovered novel mTORC1 targets; YY1, HIF and SGK1. It is unsurprising that regulation of mTORC1 is multifaceted with many positive and negative signalling inputs. We discuss the recent advances that have been made to determine the upstream mechanisms that control mTORC1 through hypoxia. energy sensing and nutrient signalling. Also discussed are current findings that have unravelled a series of novel mTORC1 associated proteins that directly control the activity of mTORC1 and include PRAS40, FKBP38, Rag GTPases and RalA.

	abstract = "Nutrient signalling by the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway involves upstream sensing of free AA (amino acid) concentrations. Several AA-regulated kinases have recently been identified as putative intracellular AA sensors. Their activity will reflect the balance between AA flows through underlying mechanisms which together determine the size of the intracellular free AA pool. For indispensable AAs, these mechanisms are primarily (i) AA transport across the cell membrane, and (ii) protein synthesis/breakdown. The System L AA transporter is the primary conduit for cellular entry of indispensable neutral AAs (including leucine and phenylalanine) and potentially a key modulator of AA-sensitive mTOR signalling. Coupling of substrate flows through System L and other AA transporters (e.g. System A) may extend the scope for sensing nutrient abundance. Factors influencing AA transporter activity (e.g. hormones) may affect intracellular AA concentrations and hence indirectly mTOR pathway activity. Several AA transporters are themselves regulated by AA availability through 'adaptive regulation', which may help to adjust the gain of AA sensing. The substrate-binding sites of AA transporters are potentially direct sensors of AA availability at both faces of the cell surface, and there is growing evidence that AA transporters of the SNAT (sodium-coupled neutral AA transporter) and PAT (proton-assisted AA transporter) families may operate, at least under some circumstances, as transporter-like sensors (or 'transceptors') upstream of mTOR.",

Recent data suggests that PDK1 specificity is achieved by regulation of its interaction with substrates and supports a rather simple model explaining how PDK1 interacts with different substrates. The data further suggests that PDK1 interacts with its substrates when they are in a particular conformation (inactive).

One of the most studied signalling events controlled by PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, comprises the activation of a group of AGC family protein kinases, including isoforms of protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt, p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K), serum- and glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase (SGK) and protein kinase C (PKC), which play crucial roles in regulating physiological processes relevant to metabolism, growth, proliferation and survival. Here, we review recent biochemical, genetic and structural studies on the 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1), which phosphorylates and activates the AGC kinase members regulated by PI 3-kinase. We also discuss whether inhibitors of PDK1 might have chemotherapeutic potential in the treatment of cancers in which the PDK1-regulated AGC kinases are constitutively activated.",

Further, transfection of the catalytically inactive mutant of PTEN (C124S) caused PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 accumulation in the absence of insulin stimulation.

We report here that insulin stimulation of Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-T) expressing human insulin receptors causes an 8-10-fold increase in PI 3,4,5-P3 5'-phosphatase activity in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates of the cell lysates. This insulin-sensitive polyphosphoinositide 5'-phosphatase did not catalyze dephosphorylation of PI 4,5-P2. No change in 5'-phosphatase activity was detected in insulin receptor or IRS-1 immune complexes in response to insulin. However, insulin treatment of CHO-T cells markedly increased the PI 3,4,5-P3 5'-phosphatase activity associated with Shc and Grb2. The insulin-regulated polyphosphoinositide 5'- phosphatase was not immunoreactive with antibody raised against the recently cloned SHIP 5'-phosphatase reported to associate with Shc and Grb2 in B lymphocytes.

We now show that the CdtB subunit exhibits phosphatidylinositol (PI)-3,4,5-triphosphate phosphatase activity. Breakdown product analysis indicates that CdtB hydrolyzes PI-3,4,5-P(3) to PI-3,4-P(2) and therefore functions in a manner similar to phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphatases. Conserved amino acids critical to catalysis in this family of enzymes were mutated in the cdtB gene. The mutant proteins exhibit reduced phosphatase activity along with decreased ability to induce G(2) arrest. Consistent with this activity, Cdt induces time-dependent reduction of PI-3,4,5-P(3) in Jurkat cells. Lymphoid cells with defects in SHIP1 and/or ptase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) (such as Jurkat, CEM, Molt) and, concomitantly, elevated PI-3,4,5-P(3) levels were more sensitive to the toxin than HUT78 cells which contain functional levels of both enzymes and low levels of PI-3,4,5-P(3). Finally, reduction of Jurkat cell PI-3,4,5-P(3) synthesis using the PI3K inhibitors, wortmannin and LY290004, protects cells from toxin-induced cell cycle arrest. Collectively, these studies show that the CdtB not only exhibits PI-3,4,5-P(3) phosphatase activity, but also that toxicity in lymphocytes is related to this activity.",

The SH2 domain-containing inositol 5' phosphatase, SHIP1, regulates hematopoietic cell function by opposing the action of phos pha tidyl ino si tol 3-kinase and reducing the levels of PtdIns 3,4,5-P(3). Activation of the cyclic AMP-de pend ent protein kinase (PKA) also opposes many of the pro-inflammatory responses of hematopoietic cells. We tested to see whether the activity of SHIP1 was regulated via phos pho ryl a tion with PKA. We prepared pure recombinant SHIP1 from HEK-293 cells and found it can be rapidly phos pho ryl a ted by PKA to a stoichiometry of 0.6 mol of PO(4)/mol of SHIP1. In (32)P-labeled HEK-293 cells transfected with SHIP1, stimulation with Sp-adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphorothioate triethylammonium salt hydrate (Sp-cAMPS) or activation of the beta-adrenergic receptor increased the phos pho ryl a tion state of SHIP1. Inhibition of protein phosphatase activity with okadaic acid also increased the phos pho ryl a tion of SHIP1. Phosphorylation of SHIP1 in vitro or in cells by PKA increased the 5' phosphatase activity of SHIP1 by 2-3-fold. Elevation of Ca(2+) in DT40 cells in response to B cell receptor cross-linking, an indicator of PtdIns 3,4,5-P(3) levels, was markedly blunted by pretreatment with Sp-cAMPS. This effect was absent in SHIP(-/-) DT40 cells showing that the effect of Sp-cAMPS in DT40 cells is SHIP1-de pend ent. Sp-cAMPS also blunted the ability of the B cell receptor to increase the phos pho ryl a tion of Akt in DT40 and A20 cells. Overall, activation of G protein-coupled receptors that raise cyclic AMP cause SHIP1 to be phosphorylated and stimulate its inositol phosphatase activity.

Moreover, mouse PDK1 knockin embryos in which either the PH domain or PIF pocket was disrupted died displaying differing phenotypes between E10.5 and E11.5. Although PDK1 plays roles in regulating cell size, cells derived from PH domain or PIF pocket knockin embryos were of normal size.

Although 40S ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation was first described 25 years ago, it only recently has been implicated in the translational up-regulation of mRNAs coding for the components of protein synthetic apparatus. These mRNAs contain an oligopyrimidine tract at their 5' transcriptional start site, termed a 5'TOP, which has been shown to be essential for their regulation at the translational level. In parallel, a great deal of information has accumulated concerning the identification of the signaling pathway and the regulatory phosphorylation sites involved in controlling S6K activation. Despite this knowledge we are only beginning to identify the direct upstream elements involved in growth factor-induced kinase activation. Use of the immunosupressant rapamycin, a bacterial macrolide, in conjunction with dominant interfering and activated forms of S6K1 has helped to establish the role of this signaling cascade in the regulation of growth and proliferation. In addition, current studies employing the mouse as well as Drosophila melanogaster have provided new insights into physiological function of S6K in the animal. Deletion of the S6K1 gene in mouse cells led to an animal of reduced size and the identification of the S6K1 homolog, S6K2, whereas loss of dS6K function in Drosophila demonstrated its paramount importance in development and growth control.",

Like TOS motif-containing proteins such as eIF4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), PRAS40 is a substrate for phosphorylation by mTORC1. Consistent with this, starvation of cells of amino acids or treatment with rapamycin alters the phosphorylation of PRAS40. PRAS40 binds 14-3-3 proteins, and this requires both amino acids and insulin. Binding of PRAS40 to 14-3-3 proteins is inhibited by TSC1/2 (negative regulators of mTORC1) and stimulated by Rheb in a rapamycin-sensitive manner. This confirms that PRAS40 is a target for regulation by mTORC1. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of PRAS40 impairs both the amino acid- and insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and the phosphorylation of S6. However, this has no effect on the phosphorylation of Akt or TSC2 (an Akt substrate). These data place PRAS40 downstream of mTORC1 but upstream of its effectors, such as S6K1 and 4E-BP1.",

	abstract = "The TOR (target of rapamycin), an atypical protein kinase, is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to man. Pharmacological studies using rapamycin to inhibit TOR and yeast genetic studies have provided key insights on the function of TOR in growth regulation. One of the first bona fide cellular targets of TOR was the mammalian protein kinase p70 S6K (p70 S6 kinase), a member of a family of kinases called AGC (protein kinase A/protein kinase G/protein kinase C-family) kinases, which include PKA (cAMP-dependent protein kinase A), PKG (cGMP-dependent kinase) and PKC (protein kinase C). AGC kinases are also highly conserved and play a myriad of roles in cellular growth, proliferation and survival. The AGC kinases are regulated by a common scheme that involves phosphorylation of the kinase activation loop by PDK1 (phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1), and phosphorylation at one or more sites at the C-terminal tail. The identification of two distinct TOR protein complexes, TORC1 (TOR complex 1) and TORC2, with different sensitivities to rapamycin, revealed that TOR, as part of either complex, can mediate phosphorylation at the C-terminal tail for optimal activation of a number of AGC kinases. Together, these studies elucidated that a fundamental function of TOR conserved throughout evolution may be to balance growth versus survival signals by regulating AGC kinases in response to nutrients and environmental conditions. This present review highlights this emerging function of TOR that is conserved from budding and fission yeast to mammals.",

When bound to FKBP12, rapamycin interacts with and inhibits the kinase activity of a multiprotein complex composed of mTOR, mLST8, and raptor (mTORC1). The distinct complex of mTOR, mLST8, and rictor (mTORC2) does not interact with FKBP12-rapamycin and is not thought to be rapamycin sensitive. mTORC2 phosphorylates and activates Akt/PKB, a key regulator of cell survival. Here we show that rapamycin inhibits the assembly of mTORC2 and that, in many cell types, prolonged rapamycin treatment reduces the levels of mTORC2 below those needed to maintain Akt/PKB signaling. The proapoptotic and antitumor effects of rapamycin are suppressed in cells expressing an Akt/PKB mutant that is rapamycin resistant. Our work describes an unforeseen mechanism of action for rapamycin that suggests it can be used to inhibit Akt/PKB in certain cell types.",

Mutation in either the TSC1 or TSC2 tumour suppressor gene is responsible for both the familial and sporadic forms of this disease. TSC1 and TSC2 proteins form a physical and functional complex in vivo. Here, we show that TSC1-TSC2 inhibits the p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (an activator of translation) and activates the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1, an inhibitor of translational initiation). These functions of TSC1-TSC2 are mediated by inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Furthermore, TSC2 is directly phosphorylated by Akt, which is involved in stimulating cell growth and is activated by growth stimulating signals, such as insulin. TSC2 is inactivated by Akt-dependent phosphorylation, which destabilizes TSC2 and disrupts its interaction with TSC1.

PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) negatively regulates Akt activation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expression of phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt), total Akt and PTEN was analyzed by Western blotting in 45 renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients. The Bad and phosphorylated Bad (p-Bad) statuses were analyzed in 20 RCC patients. A phosphatidylinositol ether analog was used as an Akt inhibitor to treat four RCC cell lines, namely Caki-1, KU19-20, SW839 and Caki-2. RESULTS: The PTEN expression in RCC was observed to decrease and p-Akt expression to increase significantly in comparison with that in the corresponding normal kidney tissue. The PTEN expression inversely correlated with the p-Akt expression. These alterations were specific for clear cell type RCC, but not for papillary or chromophobe type RCC. Alterations in Bad phosphorylation were also specifically observed in clear cell type. The Akt inhibitor induced apoptosis in KU19-20 and Caki-2 cells with a high Akt activity.

We identified several phosphorylation sites in Rictor and found that Thr1135 is directly phosphorylated by S6K1 in vitro and in vivo, in a rapamycin-sensitive manner. Phosphorylation of Rictor on Thr1135 did not affect mTORC2 assembly, kinase activity, or cellular localization. However, cells expressing a Rictor T1135A mutant were found to have increased mTORC2-dependent phosphorylation of Akt. In addition, phosphorylation of the Akt substrates FoxO1/3a and glycogen synthase kinase 3 alpha/beta (GSK3 alpha/beta) was found to be increased in these cells, indicating that S6K1-mediated phosphorylation of Rictor inhibits mTORC2 and Akt signaling.

A critical step in autophagy induction comprises the inactivation of a key negative regulator of the process, the Ser/Thr kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) [2]. Thus far, only a few substrates of mTOR that control autophagy have been identified, including ULK1 and Atg13 [3-5], both of which function as positive mediators. Here we identify death-associated protein 1 (DAP1) as a novel substrate of mTOR that negatively regulates autophagy. The link of DAP1 to autophagy was first apparent in that its knockdown enhanced autophagic flux and in that it displayed a rapid decline in its phosphorylation in response to amino acid starvation. Mapping of the phosphorylation sites and analysis of phosphorylation mutants indicated that DAP1 is functionally silenced in growing cells through mTOR-dependent phosphorylations on Ser3 and Ser51. Inactivation of mTOR during starvation caused a rapid reduction in these phosphorylation sites and converted the protein into an active suppressor of autophagy. These results are consistent with a "Gas and Brake" model in which mTOR inhibition also controls a buffering mechanism that counterbalances the autophagic flux and prevents its overactivation under nutrient deprivation},

While energy depletion inhibits mTOR through a process involving the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) by LKB1 and subsequent phosphorylation of TSC2, the mechanism of mTOR inhibition by hypoxia is not known. Here we show that mTOR inhibition by hypoxia requires the TSC1/TSC2 tumor suppressor complex and the hypoxia-inducible gene REDD1/RTP801. Disruption of the TSC1/TSC2 complex through loss of TSC1 or TSC2 blocks the effects of hypoxia on mTOR, as measured by changes in the mTOR targets S6K and 4E-BP1, and results in abnormal accumulation of Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). In contrast to energy depletion, mTOR inhibition by hypoxia does not require AMPK or LKB1. Down-regulation of mTOR activity by hypoxia requires de novo mRNA synthesis and correlates with increased expression of the hypoxia- inducible REDD1 gene. Disruption of REDD1 abrogates the hypoxia-induced inhibition of mTOR, and REDD1 overexpression is sufficient to down-regulate S6K phosphorylation in a TSC1/TSC2-dependent manner.

Previous studies have been focused on mTORC1 to elucidate the central roles of the complex in mediating nutritional and growth factor signals to the protein synthesis machinery. Functions of mTORC2, relative to mTORC1, have remained little understood. Here we report identification of a novel component of mTORC2 named PRR5 (PRoline-Rich protein 5), a protein encoded by a gene located on a chromosomal region frequently deleted during breast and colorectal carcinogenesis (Johnstone, C. N., Castellvi-Bel, S., Chang, L. M., Sung, R. K., Bowser, M. J., Pique, J. M., Castells, A., and Rustgi, A. K. (2005) Genomics 85, 338-351). PRR5 interacts with rictor, but not raptor, and the interaction is independent of mTOR and not disturbed under conditions that disrupt the mTOR-rictor interaction. PRR5, unlike Sin1, another component of mTORC2, is not important for the mTOR-rictor interaction and mTOR activity toward Akt phosphorylation. Despite no significant effect of PRR5 on mTORC2-mediated Akt phosphorylation, PRR5 silencing inhibits Akt and S6K1 phosphorylation and reduces cell proliferation rates, a result consistent with PRR5 roles in cell growth and tumorigenesis. The inhibition of Akt and S6K1 phosphorylation by PRR5 knock down correlates with reduction in the expression level of platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRbeta). PRR5 silencing impairs PDGF-stimulated phosphorylation of S6K1 and Akt but moderately reduces epidermal growth factor- and insulin-stimulated phosphorylation. These findings propose a potential role of mTORC2 in the cross-talk with the cellular machinery that regulates PDGFRbeta expression and signaling.",

Here, we demonstrate that mTOR is also part of a distinct complex defined by the novel protein rictor (rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR). Rictor shares homology with the previously described pianissimo from D. discoidieum, STE20p from S. pombe, and AVO3p from S. cerevisiae. Interestingly, AVO3p is part of a rapamycin-insensitive TOR complex that does not contain the yeast homolog of raptor and signals to the actin cytoskeleton through PKC1. Consistent with this finding, the rictor-containing mTOR complex contains GbetaL but not raptor and it neither regulates the mTOR effector S6K1 nor is it bound by FKBP12-rapamycin. We find that the rictor-mTOR complex modulates the phosphorylation of Protein Kinase C alpha (PKCalpha) and the actin cytoskeleton, suggesting that this aspect of TOR signaling is conserved between yeast and mammals.",

However, phosphorylation of this site turns over rapidly and mediates 14-3-3 binding to Rictor and mTORC2, providing possibility for altered interactions of the complex.

On the basis of age at 90\% mortality, rapamycin led to an increase of 14\% for females and 9\% for males. The effect was seen at three independent test sites in genetically heterogeneous mice, chosen to avoid genotype-specific effects on disease susceptibility. Disease patterns of rapamycin-treated mice did not differ from those of control mice. In a separate study, rapamycin fed to mice beginning at 270 days of age also increased survival in both males and females, based on an interim analysis conducted near the median survival point. Rapamycin may extend lifespan by postponing death from cancer, by retarding mechanisms of ageing, or both.

In non-dividing cells, essential components that become damaged cannot be diluted out through cell division but must, of necessity, be turned over and renewed. By elevating stress resistances, many of the activities needed for such renewal should be elevated with commensurate reduction in the steady-state levels of damaged cell components. Therefore, chronological lifespan in particular might be expected to relate to stress resistance. For yeast to attain a full chronological lifespan requires the expression of the general stress response. It is more important, though, that the cells should be efficiently adapted to respiratory maintenance, since it is cultures grown to stationary phase on respiratory media that usually display the longest chronological lifespans. For this reason, respiration-adapted cells potentially provide a better model of chronological ageing than cultures pre-grown on glucose.",

In the past few years, three inherited hamartoma syndromes, Cowden syndrome (CS), tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) syndrome, and Peutz-Jeghens syndrome (PJS), have all been linked to a common biochemical pathway: the hyperactivation of PI3K/mTORC1 intracellular signaling.

The goal of this review is to provide a roadmap for navigating the inherently complex regulation of PI3K/mTORC1 signaling while highlighting the progress that has been made in elucidating the cellular and molecular mechanisms of hamartoma syndromes and identificating potential therapeutic targets for their treatment.

Consistent with this finding, phosphorylation of IRS-1 Ser-1101 is increased in the liver of obese db/db and wild-type, but not S6K1(-/-), mice maintained on a high-fat diet and is blocked by siRNA knockdown of S6K1 protein. Finally, infusion of amino acids in humans leads to the concomitant activation of S6K1, phosphorylation of IRS-1 Ser-1101, a reduction in IRS-1 function, and insulin resistance in skeletal muscle.

Hepatic SREBP-1c is nutritionally regulated, and its sustained activation causes hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance. Although regulation of SREBP-1c is known to occur at the transcriptional level, the precise mechanism by which insulin signaling activates SREBP-1c promoter remains to be elucidated. Here we show that protein kinase C beta (PKCbeta) is a key mediator of insulin-mediated activation of hepatic SREBP-1c and its target lipogenic genes. Activation of SREBP-1c in the liver of refed mice was suppressed by either adenoviral RNAi-mediated knockdown or dietary administration of a specific inhibitor of protein kinase C beta. The effect of PKCbeta inhibition was cancelled in insulin depletion by streptozotocin (STZ) treatment of mice. Promoter analysis indicated that PKCbeta activates SREBP-1c promoter through replacement of Sp3 by Sp1 for binding to the GC box in the sterol regulatory element (SRE) complex, a key cis-element of SREBP-1c promoter. Knockdown of Sp proteins demonstrated that Sp3 and Sp1 play reciprocally negative and positive roles in nutritional regulation of SREBP-1c, respectively. This new understanding of PKCbeta involvement in nutritional regulation of SREBP-1c activation provides a new aspect of PKCbeta inhibition as a potential therapeutic target for diabetic complications.",

	abstract = "Autophagy is a self-degradative process that is important for balancing sources of energy at critical times in development and in response to nutrient stress. Autophagy also plays a housekeeping role in removing misfolded or aggregated proteins, clearing damaged organelles, such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum and peroxisomes, as well as eliminating intracellular pathogens. Thus, autophagy is generally thought of as a survival mechanism, although its deregulation has been linked to non-apoptotic cell death. Autophagy can be either non-selective or selective in the removal of specific organelles, ribosomes and protein aggregates, although the mechanisms regulating aspects of selective autophagy are not fully worked out. In addition to elimination of intracellular aggregates and damaged organelles, autophagy promotes cellular senescence and cell surface antigen presentation, protects against genome instability and prevents necrosis, giving it a key role in preventing diseases such as cancer, neurodegeneration, cardiomyopathy, diabetes, liver disease, autoimmune diseases and infections. This review summarizes the most up-to-date findings on how autophagy is executed and regulated at the molecular level and how its disruption can lead to disease.

Autophagy may have a protective role against the development of a number of neurodegenerative diseases. Here we report that loss of autophagy causes neurodegeneration even in the absence of any disease-associated mutant proteins. Mice deficient for Atg5 (autophagy-related 5) specifically in neural cells develop progressive deficits in motor function that are accompanied by the accumulation of cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in neurons. In Atg5-/- cells, diffuse, abnormal intracellular proteins accumulate, and then form aggregates and inclusions. These results suggest that the continuous clearance of diffuse cytosolic proteins through basal autophagy is important for preventing the accumulation of abnormal proteins, which can disrupt neural function and ultimately lead to neurodegeneration.",

Several proteins have emerged as major regulators of mitochondrial gene expression, capable of increasing transcription of mitochondrial genes in response to the physiological demands of the cell. In this review, we will focus on PGC-1alpha, SIRT1, AMPK and mTOR and discuss how these proteins regulate mitochondrial function and their potential involvement in aging, calorie restriction and age-related disease. We will also discuss the pathways through which mitochondria signal to the nucleus.

Like DR (dietary restriction), modulation of genes in the insulin-signaling pathway, known to alter nutrient sensing, has been shown to extend lifespan in various species. In Drosophila, the target of rapamycin (TOR) and the insulin pathways have emerged as major regulators of growth and size. Hence we examined the role of TOR pathway genes in regulating lifespan by using Drosophila. We show that inhibition of TOR signaling pathway by alteration of the expression of genes in this nutrient-sensing pathway, which is conserved from yeast to human, extends lifespan in a manner that may overlap with known effects of dietary restriction on longevity. In Drosophila, TSC1 and TSC2 (tuberous sclerosis complex genes 1 and 2) act together to inhibit TOR (target of rapamycin), which mediates a signaling pathway that couples amino acid availability to S6 kinase, translation initiation, and growth. We find that overexpression of dTsc1, dTsc2, or dominant-negative forms of dTOR or dS6K all cause lifespan extension. Modulation of expression in the fat is sufficient for the lifespan-extension effects. The lifespan extensions are dependent on nutritional condition, suggesting a possible link between the TOR pathway and dietary restriction.",

In this study, we asked whether autophagy might contribute to the lifespan extension induced by dietary restriction in C. elegans. We find that dietary restriction and TOR inhibition produce an autophagic phenotype and that inhibiting genes required for autophagy prevents dietary restriction and TOR inhibition from extending lifespan. The longevity response to dietary restriction in C. elegans requires the PHA-4 transcription factor. We find that the autophagic response to dietary restriction also requires PHA-4 activity, indicating that autophagy is a transcriptionally regulated response to food limitation. In spite of the rejuvenating effect that autophagy is predicted to have on cells, our findings suggest that autophagy is not sufficient to extend lifespan. Long-lived daf-2 insulin/IGF-1 receptor mutants require both autophagy and the transcription factor DAF-16/FOXO for their longevity, but we find that autophagy takes place in the absence of DAF-16.

These findings together with the fact that KSR contains many structural features characteristic of a protein kinase led to early speculation that KSR is a kinase functioning upstream of the Ras pathway component Raf-1 or in a parallel Ras-dependent pathway. However, in the six years since its discovery, KSR has been found to lack several key properties of known protein kinases, which has cast doubt on whether KSR is indeed a functional enzyme. A major breakthrough in our understanding of the role of KSR in signal transduction has come from recent findings that KSR interacts with several components of the MAP kinase cascade, including Raf-1, MEK1/2 and ERK1/2. The model now emerging is that KSR acts as a scaffolding protein that coordinates the assembly of a membrane-localized, multiprotein MAP kinase complex, a vital step in Ras-mediated signal transduction.

The elucidation of human cancer at the molecular level allows the design of rational, mechanism-based therapeutic agents that antagonize the specific activity of biochemical processes that are essential to the malignant phenotype of cancer cells. Because the frequency of RAS mutations is among the highest for any gene in human cancers, development of inhibitors of the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway as potential anticancer agents is a very promising pharmacologic strategy. Inhibitors of Ras signaling have been shown to revert Ras-dependent transformation and cause regression of Ras-dependent tumors in animal models. The most promising new class of these potential cancer therapeutics are the farnesyltransferase inhibitors. The development of these compounds has been driven by the observation that oncogenic Ras function is dependent upon posttranslational modification, which enables membrane binding. In contrast to many conventional chemotherapeutics, farnesyltransferase inhibitors are remarkably specific and have been demonstrated to cause no gross systemic toxicity in animals. Some orally bioavailable inhibitors are presently being evaluated in phase II clinical trials. This review presents an overview on some inhibitors of the Ras signaling pathway, including their specificity and effectiveness in vivo. Because Ras signaling plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of some hematologic malignancies, the potential therapeutic usefulness of these inhibitors is discussed. (Blood. 2000;96:1655-1669)",

@article{Wang2009,
	abstract = "BACKGROUND: The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway plays a key role in regulation of cellular growth and development. While highly studied, it is still not fully understood how the signal is orchestrated. One of the reasons for the complexity of this pathway is the extensive network of inter-connected components involved in the signaling. In the aim of identifying critical mechanisms controlling signal transduction we have performed extensive analysis of an executable model of the EGFR pathway using the stochastic pi-calculus as a modeling language. RESULTS: Our analysis, done through simulation of various perturbations, suggests that the EGFR pathway contains regions of functional redundancy in the upstream parts; in the event of low EGF stimulus or partial system failure, this redundancy helps to maintain functional robustness. Downstream parts, like the parts controlling Ras and ERK, have fewer redundancies, and more than 50\% inhibition of specific reactions in those parts greatly attenuates signal response. In addition, we suggest an abstract model that captures the main control mechanisms in the pathway. Simulation of this abstract model suggests that without redundancies in the upstream modules, signal transduction through the entire pathway could be attenuated. In terms of specific control mechanisms, we have identified positive feedback loops whose role is to prolong the active state of key components (e.g., MEK-PP, Ras-GTP), and negative feedback loops that help promote signal adaptation and stabilization. CONCLUSIONS: The insights gained from simulating this executable model facilitate the formulation of specific hypotheses regarding the control mechanisms of the EGFR signaling, and further substantiate the benefit to construct abstract executable models of large complex biological networks.",

STAT3 and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha bind simultaneously to the VEGF promoter, where they form a molecular complex with the transcription coactivators CBP/p300 and Ref-1/APE. Expression of activated Src from an inducible promoter is sufficient to increase VEGF expression and form these STAT3/HIF-1alpha-containing promoter complexes.

For over 70 yr, caloric restriction has been studied, and during the last years the number of investigations on such nutritional intervention and aging has dramatically increased. Because caloric restriction decreases the aging rate, it constitutes an excellent approach to better understand the mechanisms underlying the aging process. Various investigations have reported reductions in steady-state oxidative damage to proteins, lipids, and DNA in animals subjected to restricted caloric intake. Most interestingly, several investigations have reported that these decreases in oxidative damage are related to a lowering of mitochondrial free radical generation rate in various tissues of the restricted animals. Thus, similar to what has been described for long-lived animals in comparative studies, a decrease in mitochondrial free radical generation has been suggested to be one of the main determinants of the extended life span observed in restricted animals. In this study we review recent reports of caloric restriction and longevity, focusing on mitochondrial oxidative stress and the proposed mechanisms leading to an extended longevity in calorie-restricted animals.",

Phosphorylation at Ser473, along with Thr308 of its activation loop, is deemed necessary for Akt function, although the regulatory mechanisms and physiological importance of each phosphorylation site remain to be fully understood. Here, we report that SIN1/MIP1 is an essential TORC2/PDK2 subunit. Genetic ablation of sin1 abolished Akt-Ser473 phosphorylation and disrupted rictor-mTOR interaction but maintained Thr308 phosphorylation. Surprisingly, defective Ser473 phosphorylation affected only a subset of Akt targets in vivo, including FoxO1/3a, while other Akt targets, TSC2 and GSK3, and the TORC1 effectors, S6K and 4E-BP1, were unaffected. Our findings reveal that the SIN1-rictor-mTOR function in Akt-Ser473 phosphorylation is required for TORC2 function in cell survival but is dispensable for TORC1 function.",

We find that mTORC2 isolated from a variety of cells lacking a functional TSC1-TSC2 complex is impaired in its kinase activity toward Akt. Importantly, the defect in mTORC2 activity in these cells can be separated from effects on mTORC1 signaling and known feedback mechanisms affecting insulin receptor substrate-1 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Our data also suggest that the TSC1-TSC2 complex positively regulates mTORC2 in a manner independent of its GTPase-activating protein activity toward Rheb. Finally, we find that the TSC1-TSC2 complex can physically associate with mTORC2 but not mTORC1.

	abstract = "Connections between cancer and metabolic diseases may consist in the complex network of interactions among a common set of biomolecules. By applying singularity and bifurcation analysis, the phenotypes constrained by the AKT signaling pathway are identified and mapped onto the parameter space, which include cancer and certain metabolic diseases. By considering physiologic properties (sensitivity, robustness and adaptivity) the AKT pathway must possess in order to efficiently sense growth factors and nutrients, the region of normal responses is located. To optimize these properties, the intracellular concentration of the AKT protein must be sufficiently high to saturate its enzymes; the strength of the positive feedback must be stronger than that of the negative feedback. The analysis illuminates the parameter space and reveals system-level mechanisms in regulating biological functions (cell growth, survival, proliferation and metabolism) and how their deregulation may lead to the development of diseases. The analytical expressions summarize the synergistic interactions among many molecules, which provides valuable insights into therapeutic interventions. In particular, a strategy for overcoming the limitations of mTOR inhibition is proposed for cancer therapy.",

	abstract = "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are essential for efficient and proper execution of a large number of cellular processes including signalling induced by exogenous factors. However, ROS are highly reactive in nature and excessive or prolonged ROS formation can result in considerable damage to cellular constituents and is implicated in the onset of a large variety of diseases as well as in the process of ageing [reviewed in [1] T.M. Paravicini, R.M. Touyz, Redox signaling in hypertension, Cardiovasc. Res. 71 (2006) 247-258, [2] P. Chiarugi, From anchorage dependent proliferation to survival: lessons from redox signalling, IUBMB life 60 (2008) 301-307, [3] M. Valko, D. Leibfritz, J. Moncol, M.T. Cronin, M. Mazur, J. Telser, Free radicals and antioxidants in normal physiological functions and human disease, Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 39 (2007) 44-84]. Management of ROS to prevent potential damage, yet enabling its signalling function is achieved through numerous enzyme systems e.g. peroxidases, superoxide dismutases etc. and small molecules e.g. glutathione that collectively form the cellular anti-oxidant system. The O-class of Forkhead box (FOXO) transcription factors regulates amongst others cellular resistance against oxidative stress [[4] Y. Honda, S. Honda, The daf-2 gene network for longevity regulates oxidative stress resistance and Mn-superoxide dismutase gene expression in Caenorhabditis elegans, Faseb J. 13 (1999) 1385-1393]. In turn FOXOs themselves are regulated by ROS and cellular oxidative stress results in the activation of FOXOs [[5] M.A. Essers, S. Weijzen, A.M. de Vries-Smits, I. Saarloos, N.D. de Ruiter, J.L. Bos, B.M. Burgering, FOXO transcription factor activation by oxidative stress mediated by the small GTPase Ral and JNK, EMBO J. 23 (2004) 4802-4812]. A prominent feature of ROS-induced FOXO activation is ROS-induced binding of beta-catenin to FOXO [[6] M.A. Essers, L.M. de Vries-Smits, N. Barker, P.E. Polderman, B.M. Burgering, H.C. Korswagen, Functional interaction between beta-catenin and FOXO in oxidative stress signaling, Science (New York, NY) 308 (2005) 1181-1184, [7] M. Almeida, L. Han, M. Martin-Millan, C.A. O'Brien, S.C. Manolagas, Oxidative stress antagonizes Wnt signaling in osteoblast precursors by diverting beta-catenin from T cell factor- to forkhead box O-mediated transcription, J. Biol. Chem. 282 (2007) 27298-27305, [8] D. Hoogeboom, M.A. Essers, P.E. Polderman, E. Voets, L.M. Smits, B.M. Burgering, Interaction of FOXO with beta-catenin inhibits beta-catenin/T cell factor activity, J. Biol. Chem. 283 (2008) 9224-9230]. However, ROS affect many transcriptional programs besides that of FOXOs. Here, we discuss the recent progress in our understanding as to how ROS may regulate the interplay between some of the ROS-sensitive transcription factors through diverting beta-catenin binding to these transcription factors. We propose that beta-catenin acts as a key switch between the various ROS-sensitive transcription programs.",

A mammalian counterpart of TORC1 (mTORC1) has been described, but it is not known whether TORC2 is conserved in mammals. Here, we report that a mammalian counterpart of TORC2 (mTORC2) also exists. mTORC2 contains mTOR, mLST8 and mAVO3, but not raptor. Like yeast TORC2, mTORC2 is rapamycin insensitive and seems to function upstream of Rho GTPases to regulate the actin cytoskeleton. mTORC2 is not upstream of the mTORC1 effector S6K.

Nutrients such as amino acids are important regulators of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) activation, thus affecting cell growth, protein synthesis, and autophagy. Here, we show that amino acids may also activate mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2). This activation is mediated by the activity of class I PI3K and of Akt. Amino acids induced a rapid phosphorylation of Akt at Thr-308 and Ser-473. Whereas both phosphorylations were dependent on the presence of mTOR, only Akt phosphorylation at Ser-473 was dependent on the presence of rictor, a specific component of mTORC2. Kinase assays confirmed mTORC2 activation by amino acids. This signaling was functional, as demonstrated by the phosphorylation of Akt substrate FOXO3a. Interestingly, using different starvation conditions, amino acids can selectively activate mTORC1 or mTORC2. These findings identify a new signaling pathway used by amino acids underscoring the crucial importance of these nutrients in cell metabolism and offering new mechanistic insights.",

We show that in Drosophila and human cells the target of rapamycin (TOR) kinase and its associated protein rictor are necessary for Ser473 phosphorylation and that a reduction in rictor or mammalian TOR (mTOR) expression inhibited an Akt/PKB effector. The rictor-mTOR complex directly phosphorylated Akt/PKB on Ser473 in vitro and facilitated Thr308 phosphorylation by PDK1.

Phosphorylation of both turn motif (TM) and hydrophobic motif (HM) are important for PKC function. Here, we show that the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) has an important function in phosphorylation of both TM and HM in all conventional PKCs, novel PKCepsilon as well as Akt. Ablation of mTORC2 components (Rictor, Sin1 or mTOR) abolished phosphorylation on the TM of both PKCalpha and Akt and HM of Akt and decreased HM phosphorylation of PKCalpha. Interestingly, the mTORC2-dependent TM phosphorylation is essential for PKCalpha maturation, stability and signalling. Our study demonstrates that mTORC2 is involved in post-translational processing of PKC by facilitating TM and HM phosphorylation and reveals a novel function of mTORC2 in cellular regulation.",

The toolbox offers systems biologists an open and extensible environment, in which to explore ideas, prototype and share new algorithms, and build applications for the analysis and simulation of biological and biochemical systems. Additionally it is well suited for educational purposes. The toolbox supports the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) by providing an interface for import and export of SBML models. In this way the toolbox connects nicely to other SBML-enabled modelling packages. Models are represented in an internal model format and can be described either by entering ordinary differential equations or, more intuitively, by entering biochemical reaction equations. The toolbox contains a large number of analysis methods, such as deterministic and stochastic simulation, parameter estimation, network identification, parameter sensitivity analysis and bifurcation analysis. Availability: The Systems Biology Toolbox for MATLAB is open source and freely available from http://www.sbtoolbox2.org. The website also contains a tutorial, extensive documentation and examples.",

	abstract = "A priori global identifiability is a structural property of biological and physiological models. It is considered a prerequisite for well-posed estimation, since it concerns the possibility of recovering uniquely the unknown model parameters from measured input-output data, under ideal conditions (noise-free observations and error-free model structure). Of course, determining if the parameters can be uniquely recovered from observed data is essential before investing resources, time and effort in performing actual biomedical experiments. Many interesting biological models are nonlinear but identifiability analysis for nonlinear system turns out to be a difficult mathematical problem. Different methods have been proposed in the literature to test identifiability of nonlinear models but, to the best of our knowledge, so far no software tools have been proposed for automatically checking identifiability of nonlinear models. In this paper, we describe a software tool implementing a differential algebra algorithm to perform parameter identifiability analysis for (linear and) nonlinear dynamic models described by polynomial or rational equations. Our goal is to provide the biological investigator a completely automatized software, requiring minimum prior knowledge of mathematical modelling and no in-depth understanding of the mathematical tools. The DAISY (Differential Algebra for Identifiability of SYstems) software will potentially be useful in biological modelling studies, especially in physiology and clinical medicine, where research experiments are particularly expensive and/or difficult to perform. Practical examples of use of the software tool DAISY are presented. DAISY is available at the web site http://www.dei.unipd.it/~pia/.",

	abstract = "Cellular senescence--the permanent arrest of cycling in normally proliferating cells such as fibroblasts--contributes both to age-related loss of mammalian tissue homeostasis and acts as a tumour suppressor mechanism. The pathways leading to establishment of senescence are proving to be more complex than was previously envisaged. Combining in-silico interactome analysis and functional target gene inhibition, stochastic modelling and live cell microscopy, we show here that there exists a dynamic feedback loop that is triggered by a DNA damage response (DDR) and, which after a delay of several days, locks the cell into an actively maintained state of 'deep' cellular senescence. The essential feature of the loop is that long-term activation of the checkpoint gene CDKN1A (p21) induces mitochondrial dysfunction and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through serial signalling through GADD45-MAPK14(p38MAPK)-GRB2-TGFBR2-TGFbeta. These ROS in turn replenish short-lived DNA damage foci and maintain an ongoing DDR. We show that this loop is both necessary and sufficient for the stability of growth arrest during the establishment of the senescent phenotype.",

	abstract = "Ageing is a fundamental, unsolved mystery in biology. DAF-16, a FOXO-family transcription factor, influences the rate of ageing of Caenorhabditis elegans in response to insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-I) signalling. Using DNA microarray analysis, we have found that DAF-16 affects expression of a set of genes during early adulthood, the time at which this pathway is known to control ageing. Here we find that many of these genes influence the ageing process. The insulin/IGF-I pathway functions cell non-autonomously to regulate lifespan, and our findings suggest that it signals other cells, at least in part, by feedback regulation of an insulin/IGF-I homologue. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the insulin/IGF-I pathway ultimately exerts its effect on lifespan by upregulating a wide variety of genes, including cellular stress-response, antimicrobial and metabolic genes, and by downregulating specific life-shortening genes.",

	abstract = "Ageing is associated with an increased onset of cancer. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie the age dependency of cancer will have important implications for preventing and treating this pathology. The signalling pathway connecting insulin and FOXO transcription factors provides the most compelling example for a conserved genetic pathway at the interface between ageing and cancer. FOXO transcription factors (FOXO) promote longevity and tumour suppression. FOXO transcription factors are directly phosphorylated in response to insulin/growth factor signalling by the protein kinase Akt, thereby causing their sequestration in the cytoplasm. In the absence of insulin/growth factors, FOXO factors translocate to the nucleus where they trigger a range of cellular responses, including resistance to oxidative stress, a phenotype highly coupled with lifespan extension. FOXO factors integrate stress stimuli via phosphorylation, acetylation and mono-ubiquitination of a series of regulatory sites. Understanding how FOXO proteins integrate environmental conditions to control specific gene expression programmes will be pivotal in identifying ways to slow the onset of cancer in ageing individuals.",

	abstract = "In individual living cells p53 has been found to be expressed in a series of discrete pulses after DNA damage. Its negative regulator Mdm2 also demonstrates oscillatory behaviour. Attempts have been made recently to explain this behaviour by mathematical models but these have not addressed explicit molecular mechanisms. We describe two stochastic mechanistic models of the p53/Mdm2 circuit and show that sustained oscillations result directly from the key biological features, without assuming complicated mathematical functions or requiring more than one feedback loop. Each model examines a different mechanism for providing a negative feedback loop which results in p53 activation after DNA damage. The first model (ARF model) looks at the mechanism of p14ARF which sequesters Mdm2 and leads to stabilisation of p53. The second model (ATM model) examines the mechanism of ATM activation which leads to phosphorylation of both p53 and Mdm2 and increased degradation of Mdm2, which again results in p53 stabilisation. The models can readily be modified as further information becomes available, and linked to other models of cellular ageing.",

	abstract = "Insulin and other hormones control target cells through a network of signal-mediating molecules. Such networks are extremely complex due to multiple feedback loops in combination with redundancy, shared signal mediators, and cross-talk between signal pathways. We present a novel framework that integrates experimental work and mathematical modeling to quantitatively characterize the role and relation between co-existing submechanisms in complex signaling networks. The approach is independent of knowing or uniquely estimating model parameters because it only relies on (i) rejections and (ii) core predictions (uniquely identified properties in unidentifiable models). The power of our approach is demonstrated through numerous iterations between experiments, model-based data analyses, and theoretical predictions to characterize the relative role of co-existing feedbacks governing insulin signaling. We examined phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate-1 and endocytosis of the receptor in response to various different experimental perturbations in primary human adipocytes. The analysis revealed that receptor endocytosis is necessary for two identified feedback mechanisms involving mass and information transfer, respectively. Experimental findings indicate that interfering with the feedback may substantially increase overall signaling strength, suggesting novel therapeutic targets for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Because the central observations are present in other signaling networks, our results may indicate a general mechanism in hormonal control.",

	abstract = "Insulin signaling through insulin receptor (IR) and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1) is important for insulin control of target cells. We have previously demonstrated a rapid and simultaneous overshoot behavior in the phosphorylation dynamics of IR and IRS1 in human adipocytes. Herein, we demonstrate that in murine adipocytes a similar overshoot behavior is not simultaneous for IR and IRS1. The peak of IRS1 phosphorylation, which is a direct consequence of the phosphorylation and the activation of IR, occurs earlier than the peak of IR phosphorylation. We used a conclusive modeling framework to unravel the mechanisms behind this counter-intuitive order of phosphorylation. Through a number of rejections, we demonstrate that two fundamentally different mechanisms may create the reversed order of peaks: (i) two pools of phosphorylated IR, where a large pool of internalized IR peaks late, but phosphorylation of IRS1 is governed by a small plasma membrane-localized pool of IR with an early peak, or (ii) inhibition of the IR-catalyzed phosphorylation of IRS1 by negative feedback. Although (i) may explain the reversed order, this two-pool hypothesis alone requires extensive internalization of IR, which is not supported by experimental data. However, with the additional assumption of limiting concentrations of IRS1, (i) can explain all data. Also, (ii) can explain all available data. Our findings illustrate how modeling can potentiate reasoning, to help draw nontrivial conclusions regarding competing mechanisms in signaling networks. Our work also reveals new differences between human and murine insulin signaling.

	abstract = "Understanding the dynamics and variability of protein circuitry requires accurate measurements in living cells as well as theoretical models. To address this, we employed one of the best-studied protein circuits in human cells, the negative feedback loop between the tumor suppressor p53 and the oncogene Mdm2. We measured the dynamics of fluorescently tagged p53 and Mdm2 over several days in individual living cells. We found that isogenic cells in the same environment behaved in highly variable ways following DNA-damaging gamma irradiation: some cells showed undamped oscillations for at least 3 days (more than 10 peaks). The amplitude of the oscillations was much more variable than the period. Sister cells continued to oscillate in a correlated way after cell division, but lost correlation after about 11 h on average. Other cells showed low-frequency fluctuations that did not resemble oscillations. We also analyzed different families of mathematical models of the system, including a novel checkpoint mechanism. The models point to the possible source of the variability in the oscillations: low-frequency noise in protein production rates, rather than noise in other parameters such as degradation rates. This study provides a view of the extensive variability of the behavior of a protein circuit in living human cells, both from cell to cell and in the same cell over time.",
